            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p> To support young othelets living in Chiago
                Here are my ideas for the website. They’re not fancy.

                <h1>Vision</h1>
                <p>
                    There are places in the sketch where I’d like you to put our logo and some images (see attachments). For sample content on each page, you can use what is in the sketch. We’ll probably add some more content later.</p>
                <h1>General Information</h1>
                <p>We can worry about a nicer look for the site later. For now, I’d like to focus on getting some basic content about the league up for our current and prospective members and their parents. (And no, not everyone in our league is on Facebook! We need our own site.)
