            <h2>RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES</h2>
            <p>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein</p>
        </div>
        <h1>SPORTSMANSHIP</h1>
        <ul class="babu">
            <li>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><b>DIMENSIONS.</b> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                and older.</li>

            <li> <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b>Fields used within the competition program must
                be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                required to play all their games away.</li>
            <li> <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                        areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger. </li>
                    <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width. </li>
                    <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width. </li>
                    <li>. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
                </ol>



            </li>

                            <li> The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                                be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                                bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                                away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                                both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field </li>
                            <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
                                locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
                                to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                                and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                                the team they are supporting.</li>

                        State Competition League Only <ul>
                            <li> Except where it is determined by the referee to be
                                impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
                                touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                                outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
                                from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                                from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
                                the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                                remain within their team's bench area during the game.</li>
                            <li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
                                the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
                                on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
                                team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
                                each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
                                parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
                                enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
                                games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
                                spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
                                to comply with these standards</li>

        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by FIFA,
                USSF and USYSA.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>NUMBER OF PLAYERS</h1>
        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li> <b>TEAM SIZE.</b> Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less
                than eleven nor more than eighteen players. A team must have at least
                seven (7) players present and able to play before referees are permitted to
                start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
                be on the field at any one time during the game.</li>
            <li> <b>SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS.</b> In order to give player’s maximum
                opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
                modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
                Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
                play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
                younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
                players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)</li>
            <li>Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in
                the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
                games on reduced field size.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>SUBSTITUTIONS</h1>
        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times
                indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the game
                as a substitute at a later time. <ol>
                    <li>Prior to a throw-in your favor.</li>
                    <li>. Prior to a goalkick by either team.</li>
                    <li>After a goal by either team.</li>
                    <li>. After an injury, by either team, when the referee stops play</li>
                    <li>At half time.</li>
                    <li>When a player has been “cautioned”, only the player receiving
                        “caution” may be substituted.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES</h1>
        <ul style="list-style: square">
            <li>Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
                the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
                third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
                the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
                received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
                which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.</li>
